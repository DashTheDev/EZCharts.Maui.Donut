# Contributing
Thanks for showing an interest in helping this project thrive. The main goal is to provide developers with exactly what they need, and what better way to do that then for them to contribute directly!

Contributions can be broken down into three different types: `Issues`, `Discussions` and `Pull requests`.

Let's talk about which one is right for you.

## Issues
You should open an issue if all of the following apply:

- You've found an issue (bug/problem) with the project that is reproducible.
- It is not a double up of an issue that already exists (have a quick search).

## Discussions
You should open a discussion if all of the following apply:

- Opening an issue was not valid/appropriate.
- It is not a double up of a discussion that already exists.
- You want to discuss anything about the project, propose features or talk about certain issues.
- You're willing to keep the discussion on track (day to day conversations should be held in private).

## Pull requests
You should only make a PR if all of the following apply:

- You've discussed the changes via an `Issue`, `Discussion` or you've contacted the [repository owner](https://github.com/DashTheDev) directly. This is to ensure that changes aren't made out of scope and aren't already being worked on.
- It is not a double up of a PR that already exists.

## Important notes
Whether you're contributing with an issue, discussion or PR, please do your best to format your content with [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Doing so will make everyone's life easier!

Please also be sure to give your content descriptive titles, bodies and follow any templates provided to the best of your ability.

These guidelines aren't here to police you but rather for maintainers/contributors to spend less time reading and more time improving!
