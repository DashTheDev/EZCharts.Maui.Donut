## üç© About SimplyCharts.DonutChart

SimplyCharts.DonutChart is a focused fork of the SimplyCharts library, dedicated to creating a robust and feature-rich donut chart component for .NET MAUI applications. Our goal is to provide developers with a highly customizable, efficient, and visually appealing donut chart solution.

## üöÄ Recent Improvements

In our latest update, we've made changes to the core functionality of the DonutChart:

- **Simplified Sector Rendering**: Improved the `CreateSectorPath` method in `SKGeometry.cs` for more efficient chart rendering.
- **Enhanced Degree Calculation**: Added a new `GetDegrees` method in `CircleConstants.cs` for more accurate angle calculations.
- **Refactored DonutChartView**: Updated the `RenderData` method in `DonutChartView.cs` to utilize the new sector path creation logic.

These changes lay the groundwork for more advanced features and optimisations in future releases.
